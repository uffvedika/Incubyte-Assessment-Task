## 🧪 Test Methodology

1. **Unit Testing** — Verified each API route independently using Jest and Supertest.  
2. **Integration Testing** — Confirmed correct interactions between API routes, Prisma ORM, and the database.  
3. **Functional UI Testing** — Simulated key user flows (login, purchase, admin restock) using Playwright and manual testing.  
4. **Regression Testing** — Ensured new code did not break existing functionality.  
5. **Manual Usability Testing** — Checked responsiveness and error-handling on various browsers and screen sizes.
