##  My AI Usage

> As required, this section transparently documents how AI was used during this project.

- **Tools used:** ChatGPT (GPT-5) and GitHub Copilot  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Used ChatGPT to scaffold backend API routes, Prisma schema, and README.  
  - Generated test examples and helped with debugging.  
  - Used Copilot for small UI boilerplate (forms, validation).  
- **Verification:**  
  - All AI-generated code was reviewed, debugged, and modified.  
  - Authentication and DB logic were manually verified.  
- **Commit Co-authorship:**  
  - For AI-assisted commits, the following trailer was used:
    ```
    Co-authored-by: ChatGPT <AI@users.noreply.github.com>
    ```
- **Reflection:**  
  - AI reduced setup time and improved clarity in structuring a full-stack app.  
  - Manual oversight ensured correctness and security.
